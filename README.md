Installation

Sure, here are the steps you should follow in order:

Execute the "plot_values.py" file to compute the results of SBCov and generate interval plots for each dimension, similar to Figure 5 in the paper.

Run the "plot_graph.py" script to generate the average reward graph for the algorithms.

Use the "one-two.py" script to calculate the results for each coverage criterion and the correlation coefficients between algorithm average rewards.

Run the "num_score.py" script to calculate the number of low-scoring episodes in each experiment and record the corresponding coverage criterion results.

Finally, execute the "load_dict.py" script to compute coverage criterion results and save them in a ".csv" file.

Make sure to follow these steps in sequence to obtain the desired experimental results.
